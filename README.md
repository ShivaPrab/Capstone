# Project Description 

The nature of real estate has changed. The typical model for property owners attempting to generate passive income is to optimize rental prices & lease terms. 
Truly successful property owners (aka landlords, but I believe that term has been outdated) are able to build strong relationships with their tenants. 
Futher, they are able to quickly deploy relevant supervisors to ensure the health of 

Watershed, a property management company, corners a niche market, alleviating property owners 

This project explores the possibility of converting 244 from long term rentals into short term rentals. Quantifying the results of this analysis will have to show the relevant
year-end metrics, and how they change based upon the conversion. Further, the costs associated with running a short term rental are fundamentally different than their long term 
counter parts. For instance, property owners typically do not pay for utilities on a long term rental, and it would be more than unreasonable for owners to expect the same from 
their short-term guests. 

This analysis project attempts to create a robust financial model, quantifying 4 relevant year end metrics, and visualizes the results of the analysis into 3 mediums: 
  1.) A Tableau Dashboard, complete with variable parameters that can be adjusted at user input 
  2.) A White Paper, suitable for professional business meetings 
  3.) A PowerPoint Presentation & Voice Over
